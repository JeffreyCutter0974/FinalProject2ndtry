 <h2>
    After making everyone wait nearly one month longer than usual, the NFL is finally going to reveal the 2020 schedule on Thursday, and although there are plenty of questions that won't be answered when the schedule drops Will fans be allowed to attend games? Will the season start on time? What happens if a player tests positive during the season? For instance, we're finally going to know which two teams will be playing in the NFL opener, which is currently scheduled for Thursday, Sept. 10. One team that will almost certainly be on the field is the Kansas City Chiefs, and that's because the defending Super Bowl champs have hosted the traditional Thursday night opener in 14 of the past 16 years.

    Although the NFL changed the tradition last year so that the Bears and Packers could kick off the league's 100th season, the NFL is expected to return to tradition this year and let the defending champ host the opening game, which means the season will be opening in Kansas City. One clue that the opener will be happening in KC is the fact that the Royals have already agreed to move their game on Sept. 10 so that the Chiefs would have full use of the parking lot that serves both Arrowhead and Kauffman Stadiums. So who will the Chiefs be playing in the opener? We already know all the Chiefs home opponents for 2020 -- Broncos, Raiders, Chargers, Patriots, Jets, Falcons, Panthers, Texans
