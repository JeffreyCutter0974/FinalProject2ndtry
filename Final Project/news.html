        What you need to know about coronavirus on Wednesday, May 6. The US death toll has topped 70,000. Testing is nowhere near the level it needs to be. And experts warn that the worst may still be ahead. Yet on Tuesday, a senior Trump administration official told CNN the White House would start to wind down its coronavirus task force by the end of the month. Disbanding the task force and effectively declaring victory over a virus still spreading through the country raises questions about the administration's priorities. Less than six months from Election Day, President Donald Trump seems to be shifting gears from pandemic management to a message of revival and a pitch for his second term election campain.</h2>

    <h2> The news comes in the wake of a leaked internal White House report that suggests that daily deaths could climb to 3,000 by June, and an extensive whistleblower complaint from an ousted vaccine director alleging that early warnings about the virus were met with "indifference which then developed into hostility" by leaders at the Department of Health and Human Services. Donning safety glasses, but no mask, Trump visited a plant manufacturing medical masks in Arizona one of his battleground states in the 2020 presidential election to make the case for reopening the economy. Addressing the media, the President appeared to admit that he was reconciled to the deaths epidemiologists say will result from a premature return to normal life.</h2>
